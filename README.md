On the display you can see falling figures randomly shape, randomly spawned at the top of display. You can drive amount emerging per second figures. Also you can set Gravity value.

By clicking to any figure, it will disappear. By clicking at any empty space, a figure will spawn. Try it one! Enjoy=)
